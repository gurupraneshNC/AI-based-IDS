# 🤖 AI-based-IDS

---

## 🚀 Overview

AI-based-IDS is an open-source project that uses machine learning techniques to build an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that can analyze network data and identify malicious activity. Intrusion detection plays a vital role in defending modern networks against cyber threats and anomalous traffic patterns.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This repository includes:

✔ Exploratory data analysis  
✔ Binary & multi-class ML classification models  
✔ Interactive Jupyter notebooks  
✔ A WebAPP for real-time testing (if developed)
